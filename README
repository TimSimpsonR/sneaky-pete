Welcome sneakers. This is a guest. This is only a guest.

PS when running make, be sure to declare the LIB_HOME, LIB_HOME=/usr/local/lib


Setting up Your Environment
---------------------------

The easiest way is to use Vagrant to create a VM. Once you're inside the VM,
running the script /src/vagrant/initialize.sh should install all tools and
dependencies.


How to Build
------------

This can currently be built with both Make and Boost Build (mostly because I
know Boost Build better than make. ~Tim).

To run with Make, simply type "make" in the home directory.

To run with Boost Build, type "Boost Build."


Understanding the Unit Tests
----------------------------

The unit tests currently use Boost Test executed with Valgrind to detect
memory leaks. These tests do not currently cause the build to fail if there is
a leak (Working on that. ~Tim).

The important thing is that "definetely lost," "indirectly lost", and
"possibly lost" all be 0 bytes. Sometimes "still reachable" may be more than
zero due to some libraries containing pointers to freed memory on program exit.
