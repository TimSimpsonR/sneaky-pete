Welcome sneakers. This is a guest. This is only a guest.

Setting up Your Environment
===========================

You can build Sneaky Pete on your real machine, or on its own VM using the
included Vagrantfile, but the recommended (and currently used) method is to
build it inside the Reddwarf Vagrant VM.

How to use Vagrant and how to build Reddwarf is beyond the scope of this file,
so if you're curious check these links for more info:

How to Automatically Build and Package with Reddwarf
====================================================
When setting up the Reddwarf VM, make sure you set an environment variable with
the name REDDWARF_AGENT to the directory to the directory containing this file,
and the Reddwarf CI scripts should automatically build and package this agent.


How to Build
============
This sections explains what the Reddwarf CI scripts do.

This project is built using Boost Build v2, a build tool used to build the
Boost libraries. The command for this program is "bjam".

The script "vagrant/initialize.sh" will install Boost Build and other
dependencies needed by the build process.

Boost Build is driven by the file "Jamroot.jam" in the root directory. To invoke
Boost Build, type "bjam" at the command line.

To build the Sneaky Pete, cd into this directory and type the following:

bjam -d+2 link=static release nova-guest

"-d+2" is optional and tells Boost Build to print out every command it executes.
Boost Build will take awhile to start up, so if you keep getting compiler
errors in a file a good technique is to copy the command it executes and run
that instead until you can build the necessary target without errors.

"link=static" will, as implied, build the project with static linking.
Otherwise, all dependencies will be dynamically linked. Some targets however
can not be built statically (see the Jamroot.jam file for details) and ignore
this request (the tests are an example).

"release" causes bjam to build in the release configuration. By default it will
use the debug version (you can specify this with "debug").


Understanding the Build File
============================

The Unit Rule
-------------
The file uses a custom unit rule. Each time this rule is invoked, it creates a
named logical target, specifies the source files to be included in the
resulting object file, the other object and library files the given source will
need to work when linked together, the unit test source code (if any) and the
object and library files the unit test might need.

To build a particular unit, give bjam the logical name on the command line. For
example:

bjam -d+2 u_nova_json

will build the object file for the json code and also build and run its unit
tests.

All of these unit tests run when the entire program is built.

Valgrind
--------
The unit tests currently use Boost Test executed with Valgrind to detect
memory leaks. These tests do not currently cause the build to fail if there is
a leak which is unfortunate. Valgrind also produces a large number of false
positives. Therefore its up to the maintainers right now to watch these results
carefully when updating the code.

The important thing is that "definitely lost," "indirectly lost", and
"possibly lost" all be 0 bytes. Sometimes "still reachable" may be more than
zero due to some libraries containing pointers to freed memory on program exit.


Functional Tests
----------------
In addition to the unit tests, there are functional tests which do not run
automatically as they require certain dependencies to be installed.

For example, the MySQL code needs to run against a real mysql database and
create tables. Forcing this to be present just to build the code could be
an impediment in some situations.

To run the functional tests, specify the target name when calling bjam. For
example:

bjam -d+2 send_and_receive

Will build the tests for AMQP functionality.

All of these functional tests are executed by the Reddwarf package scripts
mentioned above.


Debugging in the Reddwarf Vagrant VM
------------------------------------
To debug in the Reddwarf test environment, you must uninstall any
existing instance of the guest package by executing the following statement:

sudo -E reprepro -Vb /var/www/debian remove squeeze nova-guest
sudo apt-get update

At this point, any time you create an instance it will eventually time out
because the agent will never install.

However, during the time out phase you can manually install a statically linked
debug version of Sneaky Pete into the instance and run it. Here's how:

1. Wait for an instance to be created. You can run all of the Reddwarf
integration tests by running "/vagrant/reddwarf-ci tests" (remember that this
is in the Reddwarf VM environment) or just create a container by executing
"/vagrant/reddwarf-ci tests --group=dbaas.guest.initialize".

2. When the OpenVZ container is created, copy this entire directory (the one
with the README file you're reading right now) into it by executing the script
"copy-to-guest.sh" which is in this directory with the ID of the container as
an argument. For example if the container appears as container 1 when you
execute "sudo vzlist", then:

/agent/copy-to-guest.sh 1

3. Enter the container with "sudo vzctl enter 1".

4. Install gdb with:

sudo apt-get install gdb

5. Login as the nova user on the vagrant image.

su nova

6. Inside the /agent directory, execute the statically-linked debug version of
Sneaky-Pete with the following command (this file was copied here in step 2):

gdb /agent/bin/gcc-4.4.5/debug/link-static/nova-guest

7. Once gdb is started, run it with the flag files via

run --flagfile=/agent/debian/guest.conf

When Reddwarf creates an instance, it sends a message out on AMQP to prepare
the guest. This message sits in the queue until the guest "wakes up" and
receives it. As soon as the agent is started, it will begin to process the
"prepare" command, which if you're new to the code is probably the most
difficult one to follow.

If you'd like to avoid this, you can instead start a working instance and then
enter into the OpenVZ container and kill the existing guest agent and run your
own version of the agent in its place by executing commands 2 and 5. You can
then manually test that the instance works.

8. To run the release mode in the container without debugging just execute the command:

/agent/bin/gcc-4.4.5/release/link-static/nova-guest --flagfile=/agent/debian/guest.conf
